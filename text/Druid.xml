<Body><div id="intro"><p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Cast your eyes around the fire. What has brought you to these people, stinking of the dust and sweat of the city? Perhaps it is a kindness—do you protect them as the mother bear watches over her cubs? Are they your pack, now? Strange brothers and sisters you have. Whatever your inspiration, they would certainly fail without your sharp senses and sharper claws.</p>
<p>You are of the sacred spaces; you are born of soil and wear the marks of her spirits on your skin. You may have had a life before, maybe you were a city dweller like them, but not now. You’ve given up that static shape. Listen to your allies pray to their carved stone gods and polish their silver shells. They speak of the glory they’ll find back in that festering town you left behind.</p>
<p>Their gods are children, their steel is false protection. You walk the old ways, you wear the pelts of the earth itself. You’ll take your share of the treasure, but will you ever walk as one of them? Only time will tell.</p></div>

<div id="racialmoves"><h3 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Elf</h3>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">The sap of the elder trees flows within you. In addition to any other attunements, the Great Forest is always considered your land.</p>
<h3 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Human</h3>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">As your people learned to bind animals to field and farm, so too are you bound to them. You may always take the shape of any domesticated animal, in addition to your normal options.</p>
<h3 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Halfling</h3>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">You sing the healing songs of spring and brook. When you make camp, you and your allies heal +1d6.</p></div>
<div id="classmoves"><p aid:pstyle="Instructions">You start with these moves:</p>
<div id="BornoftheSoil"><h3 aid:pstyle="BasicMoveName">Born of the Soil</h3>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">You learned your magic in a place whose spirits are strong and ancient and they’ve marked you as one of their own. No matter where you go, they live within you and allow you to take their shape. Choose one of the following. It is the land to which you are attuned—when shapeshifting you may take the shape of any animal who might live in your Land.</p>
<ul><li aid:pstyle="Option">The Great Forests</li>
<li aid:pstyle="Option">The Whispering Plains</li>
<li aid:pstyle="Option">The Vast Desert</li>

<li aid:pstyle="Option">The Frozen North</li>
<li aid:pstyle="Option">The Blasted Wasteland</li></ul>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Chose a tell—a physical attribute that marks you as born of the soil—that reflects the spirit of your land. It may be an animal feature like antlers or leopard’s spots or something more general: hair like leaves or eyes of glittering crystal. Your tell remains no matter what shape you take.</p></div>
<div id="ByNatureSustained"><h3 aid:pstyle="BasicMoveName">By Nature Sustained</h3>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">You don’t need to eat or drink. If a move tells you to mark off a ration just ignore it.</p></div>
<div id="SpiritTongue"><h3 aid:pstyle="BasicMoveName">Spirit Tongue</h3>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">The grunts, barks, chirps, and calls of the creatures of the wild are as language to you. You can understand any animal native to your land or akin to one whose essence you have studied.</p></div>

<p>You may take on the physical form of any species whose essence you have studied or who lives in your land: you and your possessions meld into a perfect copy of the species’ form. You have any innate abilities and weaknesses of the form: claws, wings, gills, breathing water instead of air. You still use your normal stats but some moves may be harder to trigger—a housecat will find it hard to do battle with an ogre. The GM will also tell you one or more moves associated with your new form. Spend 1 hold to make that move. Once you’re out of hold, you return to your natural form. At any time, you may spend all your hold and revert to your natural form.</p></div>
<div id="StudiedEssence"><h3 aid:pstyle="BasicMoveName">Studied Essence</h3>
