<Body><div><h2>Cantrips</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">You prepare all of your cantrips every time you Prepare Spells without having to select them or count them toward your allotment of spells.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Light</span>	Cantrip</p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">An item you touch glows with arcane light, about as bright as a torch. It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel, but it is otherwise like a mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Unseen Servant</span>	Cantrip</p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">You conjure a simple invisible construct that can do nothing but carry items. It has Load 2 and carries anything you hand to it. It cannot pick up items on its own and can only carry those you give to it. Items carried by an unseen servant appear to float in the air a few paces behind you. An unseen servant that takes damage or leaves your presence is immediately dispelled, dropping any items it carried.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Prestidigitation</span>	Cantrip</p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">You perform minor tricks of true magic. If you touch an item as part of the casting you can make cosmetic changes to it: clean it, soil it, cool it, warm it, flavor it, or change its color. If you cast the spell without touching an item you can instead create minor illusions no bigger than yourself. Prestidigitation illusions are crude and clearly illusions—they won't fool anyone, but they might entertain them.</p></div>
<div><p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Contact Spirits</span>	Level 1	<em>Summoning</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Name the spirit you wish to contact (or leave it to the GM). You pull that creature through the planes, just close enough to speak to you. It is bound to answer any one question you ask to the best of its ability.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Detect Magic</span>	Level 1	<em>Divination</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">One of your senses is briefly attuned to magic. The GM will tell you what here is magical.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Telepathy</span>	Level 1	<em>Divination</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">You form a telepathic bond with a single person you touch, enabling you to speak to that person through your thoughts. You can only have one telepathic bond at a time.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Charm Person</span>	Level 1	<em>Enchantment</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">The person (not beast or monster) you touch while casting this spell counts you as a friend until they take damage or you prove otherwise.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Invisibility</span>	Level 1	<em>Illusion Ongoing</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Touch an ally: nobody can see them. They're invisible! The spell persists until the target attacks or you dismiss the effect. While the spell is ongoing you can't Cast a Spell.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Magic Missile</span>	Level 1	<em>Evocation</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Projectiles of pure magic spring from your fingers. Deal 2d4 damage to one target.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Alarm</span>	Level 1</p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Walk a wide circle as you cast this spell. Until you prepare spells again your magic will alert you if a creature crosses that circle. Even if you are asleep, the spell will shake you from your slumber.</p></div>
<div><p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Dispel Magic</span>	Level 3</p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Choose a spell or magic effect in your presence: this spell rips it apart. Lesser spells are ended, powerful magic is just reduced or dampened so long as you are nearby.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Visions Through Time</span>	Level 3	<em>Divination</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Cast this spell and gaze into a reflective surface to see into the depths of time. The GM will reveal the details of a Grim Portent to you—a bleak event that will come to pass without your intervention. They'll tell you something useful about how you can interfere with the Grim Portent's dark outcomes. Rare is the Portent that claims "You'll live happily ever after." Sorry.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Fireball</span>	Level 3	Evocation</p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">You evoke a mighty ball of flame that envelops your target and everyone nearby, inflicting 2d6 damage which ignores armor.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Mimic</span>	Level 3	<em>Ongoing</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">You take the form of someone you touch while casting this spell. Your physical characteristics match theirs exactly but your behavior may not. This change persists until you take damage or choose to return to your own form. While this spell is ongoing you lose access to all your wizard moves.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Mirror Image</span>	Level 3	<em>Illusion</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">You create an illusory image of yourself. The next attack against you effects the illusory image, not you. The image then dissipates.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Sleep</span>	Level 3	<em>Enchantment</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">1d4 enemies you can see of the GM's choice fall asleep. Only creatures capable of sleeping are effected. They awake as normal: loud noises, jolts, pain.</p></div>
<div><p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Cage</span>	Level 5	<em>Evocation Ongoing</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">The target is held in a cage of magical force. Nothing can get in or out of the cage. The cage remains until you cast another spell or dismiss it. While the spell is ongoing, the caged creature can hear your thoughts and you cannot leave sight of the cage.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Contact Other Plane</span>	Level 5	<em>Divination</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">You send a request to another plane. Specify who or what you'd like to contact by location, type of creature, name, or title. You open a two-way communication with that creature. Your communication can be cut off at any time by you or the creature you contacted.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Polymorph</span>	Level 5	<em>Enchantment</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Your touch reshapes a creature entirely, they stay in the form you craft until you Cast a Spell. Describe the new shape you craft, including any stat changes, significant adaptations, or major weaknesses. The GM will then tell you one or more of these:</p>
<ul><li>The form will be unstable and temporary</li>
<li>The creature's mind will be altered as well</li>
<li>The form has an unintended benefit or weakness</li></ul>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Summon Monster</span>	Level 5	<em>Summoning Ongoing</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">A monster appears and aids you as best it can. Treat it as your character, but with access to only the basic moves. It has +1 modifier for all stats and 1 HP. The monster also gets your choice of 1d6 of these traits: </p>
<ul><li>It has +2 instead of +1 to one stat (you may choose this trait up to two times)</li>

<div><p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Dominate</span>	Level 7	<em>Enchantment Ongoing</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Your touch pushes your mind into someone else's. You gain 1d4 hold. Spend one hold to make the target take one of these actions:</p>
<ul><li>Speak a few words of your choice</li>
<li>Give you something they hold</li>
<li>Make a concerted attack on a target of your choice</li>
<li>Truthfully answer one question</li></ul>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">If you run out of hold the spell ends. If the target takes damage you lose 1 hold. While the spell is ongoing you cannot Cast a Spell.</p>

<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">Choose a 5th level or lower spell you know. Describe a trigger condition using a number of words equal to your level. The chosen spell is held until you choose to unleash it or the trigger condition is met, whichever happens first. You don't have to roll for the held spell, it just takes effect. You may only have a single contingent spell held at a time; if you cast Contingency while you have a held spell, the new held spell replaces the old one. </p>
<p aid:pstyle="SpellName"><span aid:cstyle="SpellName">Cloudkill</span>	Level 7	<em>Summoning</em></p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">A cloud of fog drifts into this realm from beyond the Black Gates of Death, filling the immediate area.
