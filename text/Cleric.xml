<Body><div id="intro"><p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">The lands of Dungeon World are a gods-forsaken mess. They’re lousy with the walking dead, beasts of all sorts, and the vast unnatural spaces between safe and temple-blessed civilizations. It is a godless world out there. That’s why it needs you.</p>
<p>Bringing the glory of your god to the heathens isn’t just in your nature—it’s your calling. It falls to you to proselytize with sword and mace and spell. To cleave deep into the witless heart of the wilds and plant the seed of divinity there. Some say that it is best to keep god close to your heart. You know that’s rubbish. God lives at the edge of a blade.
Show the world who is lord.</p></div>

<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">On a 10+, intelligent undead are momentarily dazed and mindless undead flee. Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act as normal. Intelligent undead may still find ways to harry you from afar. They're clever like that.</p></div>

<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">On a 7-9, the spell is cast, but choose one:</p>
<ul><li>You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.</li>
<li>Your casting distances you from your deity—take -1 ongoing to Cast a Spell until the next time you Commune.</li>
<li>After you cast it, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot cast the spell again until you Commune and have it granted to you.</li></ul>
